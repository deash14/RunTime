expected, distance, comment
 null,    junk,    bad values should not be allowed leaving what was there previously.  This needs to be the first test.
 13.1,    13.1,    postivite numbers should work.  If this is the first test then MSTest expects all "expected" and "distance" values to be numeric.
 null,   -13.1,    negative numbers should set distance to zero
