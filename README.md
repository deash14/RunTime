# RunTime
Simple program to calculate either pace/time/distance given the other two parameters.

Created to learn a bit more about WPF programming in visual studios.

Has five projects:<br/>
  <ul>
  <li>Wpf - contains the gui code.  All done in xaml with no code behind.</li>
  <li>ViewModels - contains the "glue" code between the gui and the model.</li>
  <li>ViewModelsTest - contains the unit tests for the ViewModel.</li>
  <li>Model - contains the "business" logic of the application.</li>
  <li>ModelTest - contains the unit tests for the model.</li>
  </ul>
  
Also uses OpenCover to create html output showing the code coverage.  Run the "OpenCover.bat" file to generate output in the GeneratedReports directory.
